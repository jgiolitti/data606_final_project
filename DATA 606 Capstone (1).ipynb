    "    - Carbohydrates: 10–30% (target ~20%)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### Substitution Guidelines:\n",
    "    - Prioritize lean protein sources.\n",
    "    - Avoid cream, butter, full-fat cheese, fatty meats, or excessive oils.\n",
    "    - Use low-fat cooking methods (grilling, baking, steaming).\n",
    "    - Favor vegetables and legumes over starchy carbs.\n",
    "    - Use cooking spray or broth instead of oil where possible.\n",
    "    - **Only make substitutions that are likely to still taste good and preserve the appeal of the dish.** Avoid swaps that would make \n",
    "    the texture or flavor unpleasant.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Avoid high-fat ingredients such as:\n",
    "    - oils (even olive oil or coconut oil)\n",
    "    - cream, butter, or cheese (unless low-fat versions are used in moderation)\n",
    "    - fatty meats (like bacon, sausage, ground beef)\n",
    "    - full-fat dairy\n",
    "    - avocados, nuts, and seeds (limit to small quantities only if essential)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Use the following **low-fat flavor and texture enhancers** instead:\n",
    "    - vinegar, lemon juice, mustard, garlic, spices\n",
    "    - vegetable purées (e.g., carrot, cauliflower, zucchini)\n",
    "    - low-fat dairy alternatives (e.g., non-fat Greek yogurt, fat-free cottage cheese)\n",
    "    - broth-based sauces instead of cream sauces\n",
    "\n",
    "    If fat content exceeds 35%, **revise the recipe to reduce fat** until it falls between 20–35%. \n",
